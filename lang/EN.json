In this game one of the players will be chosen to be a spy: he will have to infiltrate among the other players <i>using his intuition and his spying skills</i>.<br>Everyon will be assigned a shared location and everyone but the spy will know the location (e.g. \"the supermarket\") and theyr assigned rolf (e.g. \"cashier\" or \"customer\").<br>One of the player is randomly chosen to be the first and will start the game by asking another player a question about the shared location; that player will answer and will ask another player another question and so on.</p>\n<p>The spy wins if he manages to guess the shared location, hwile \"normal\" players win if they guess who is the spy.<br>The difficulty (and the fun) lies in making the right questions: ask an extremely precise question and you will have given away the location to the spy, but ask an extremely broad question and noone will benefit from it!</p>\n<p>The spy can try and guess the loaction at any moment (for example asking \"Are we in the military base?\"). If that's right he wins, while if that's wrong everyone else wins.<br>Any player can ask a vote for the spy simply by stating who he thinks the spy is: if the majority of the players agrees the suspected player is <b>accused</b> and must immediately reveal if he was the spy or not: if he was not then the spy wins, but if he was he still has one last chance of wild guessing the location. If he does he wins, otherwise everyone else wins. The spy automatically wins if the timer reaches \"00:00\"</p>\n<p>Remember the social nature of this game: don't be distracted by your smartphone and use it only when necessary: focus on people around you and try to call the spy's bluff! (Pro-tip: it also makes you more <i>spyish</i> if you constantly look down and the locations never interacting and avoiding eye contact)</p>",
